# Insertion Sort

## Description

## Theoretical Running Time


## insertsort.py

### Usage
`python3 insertsort.py`

### Input
Input is from a file called `data.txt`.  Each line in `data.txt` is an input to sort.  That is, a list of integers separated by spaces.

### Output
The sorted inputs (each line) are written to a file called `insert.out` in the same line-order that is in the `data.txt` input.

## Experimental Running Time

# Data & Graph
Array size is denoted by the variable `n`.

| n | Time (s) |

# Conclusion
The experimental running time for Insertion sort is directly related to the square of the size of the input, which aligns with the theoretical running time of Î˜(n<sup>2</sup>).
